### Join your friends in a game of D&D online while keeping your desk neat & tidy by utilizing our D&D character library. This library can be used to store all of your characters & stats in one place and be quickly referenced by a simple click. You can even use the built in D&D dice to generate ability scores.

## Acceptance Criteria

Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.  
Use Handlebars.js as the templating engine.  
Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.  
Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.  
Be deployed using Heroku (with data).  
Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed.  
Have a polished UI.  
Be responsive.  
Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).  
Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.  
Include authentication (express-session and cookies).  
Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.  
Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).  
Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application)
